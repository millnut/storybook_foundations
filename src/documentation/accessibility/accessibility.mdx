<h1>Accessibility</h1>

Web Accessibility is focused on ensuring people with disabilities can equally perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with digital content. It also means that they can contribute equally like anyone else.
Web Accessibility is based on guidelines published by The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) for accessible content called Web Content Accessibility Guidelines or WCAG.
